            Processor DPC time is the time that a single processor spent receiving and servicing deferred procedure 
            calls (DPCs). DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than standard interrupts. % DPC Time is a 
            component of % Privileged Time because DPCs are executed in privileged mode. If a high % DPC Time is 
            sustained, there may be a processor bottleneck or an application or hardware related issue that can 
            significantly diminish overall system performance.

            The Processor Information\% Interrupt Time is the time the processor spends receiving and servicing 
            hardware interrupts during sample intervals. This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of 
            devices that generate interrupts, such as the system clock, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication 
            lines, network interface cards and other peripheral devices. This is an easy way to identify a potential 
            hardware failure. This should never be higher than 20%.

            Context Switches/sec is the combined rate at which all processors on the computer are switched from one thread to another.
            Context switches occur when a running thread voluntarily relinquishes the processor, is preempted by a higher priority ready thread, or switches between user-mode and privileged (kernel) mode to use an Executive or subsystem service.
            It is the sum of Thread\\Context Switches/sec for all threads running on all processors in the computer and is measured in numbers of switches.
            There are context switch counters on the System and Thread objects. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
